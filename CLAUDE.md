# norma

**norma** — named for the constellation Norma, the Level (Carpenter's Square): the instrument that shows what is actually true and straight, not what merely looks fine. Latin *norma* means "rule, standard."

## Purpose

Shows Canadians what they can genuinely afford to buy or rent — computed from real net income and real carrying costs, with each province's actual tax and cost-of-ownership rules built in, not GDS/TDS bank-approval math. English and French.

## Stack

Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack) · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS v4 · shadcn/ui (Radix base, Nova preset) · next-intl (locales: en, fr, prefix `/en` `/fr`) · Vitest + Testing Library

## Commands (scripts contract — always use these, never raw stack commands)

- `scripts/check` — `eslint . && tsc --noEmit && vitest run --changed`
- `scripts/test`  — `vitest run` (full suite)
- `scripts/build` — `next build`
- `scripts/ship`  — not configured yet; deploy target undecided (Vercel is the default fit for Next.js — confirm before wiring)

## Conventions

- App Router pages/layouts live under `src/app/[locale]/`; every route is locale-prefixed via `src/proxy.ts` (Next 16 renamed `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts` — don't recreate a `middleware.ts` file).
- User-facing strings go in `messages/en.json` / `messages/fr.json`, read via `useTranslations()` / `getTranslations()` from `next-intl` — no hardcoded UI copy.
- shadcn/ui components: `npx shadcn@latest add <component>` (this project's shadcn CLI needs explicit `-b radix -p nova` if it re-prompts).
- Branches: `claude/<ticket-or-slug>`; commits: conventional commits; never push to `main`.
- Tests accompany every behavior change; `scripts/check` must pass before review.

## Workflow

Implement → invoke `reviewer` subagent on the diff → fix → repeat until approved → `scripts/test` → PR via `gh pr create` (no Linear tracker configured for this project yet).

## Deployment

Not yet configured. No CI reviewer workflow installed yet either — add `.github/workflows/claude-review.yml` when ready (needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret or the GitHub Claude app).

## Open product decisions

1. **Affordability formula** — resolved for Phase 1. Two ceilings, computed side by side: a
   bank-style GDS/TDS-qualified ceiling, and a real-carrying-cost "comfort" ceiling (net income
   minus property tax, insurance, condo/strata fees, utilities, maintenance reserve, minus a
   stress-test margin). See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-17-phase1-affordability-design.md`.
2. **Scope: homebuying only, or rent too?** — resolved: buy first (Phase 1 = domain layer + Home +
   Affordability), rent-vs-buy and the other 6 tool pages (Closing Costs, Down Payment, RRSP-HBP,
   Amortization, Rent vs Buy, Scenarios) are each a later phase's own spec, built on the same
   domain layer. See the Phase 1 spec for the full page list and sequencing rationale.
3. **Monetization** — still explicitly undecided (see README `## Status`). Don't bake "always free"
   into copy, architecture, or feature gating.

## Prior design work — `design-reference/`

A previous Claude Design session ("Norma" project, claude.ai/design) produced a working prototype:
a pure calculation engine, a 14-jurisdiction Canadian rules dataset, and 8 designed pages in 4
languages. It's pulled into this repo at `design-reference/` in Claude Design's own canvas format
(not runnable React — reference material to port from). Excluded from `eslint.config.mjs`'s
ignores; not part of the app. Treat it as the source of truth for calculation logic and jurisdiction
data when porting — see the Phase 1 spec for what's been ported into `src/domain/` and what's still
pending in `design-reference/` for later phases.

## Don't

- Don't hardcode province rules inline in components — they live in `src/domain/jurisdictions/*.ts`,
  one typed file per jurisdiction, ported from `design-reference/hbt-data.js`. See the Phase 1 spec.
- Don't add a deploy target or CI workflow without asking — monetization (above) is still open.
